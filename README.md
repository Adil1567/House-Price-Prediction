# House-Price-Prediction
This project builds a real estate price prediction site using a linear regression model on Bangalore's dataset. A Flask server handles HTTP requests, while HTML/CSS/JavaScript forms the front end. Techniques like data cleaning, feature engineering, and model validation are employed. Deployment is on AWS EC2 with Nginx managing content and routing.
